# net-level

[LevelDB is an open-source on-disk key-value store](https://github.com/google/leveldb).

Net-level provides shared authenticated network-based access to leveldb instances:

- as scalable and robust as leveldb without in-process limitations.
- adds simple user-based authentication and granular db-level permissions.
